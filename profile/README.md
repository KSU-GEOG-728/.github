## GEOG 728 Programming for Geographic Analysis - Python

Python is a general-purpose interpreted, interactive, object-oriented and high-level programming language with broad applications in data analytics and across sciences.  As with other open-source software packages such as ‚ÄúR‚Äù, an understanding of Python is helpful ‚Äì if not essential ‚Äì in accomplishing sophisticated computational tasks.  Adding to the value of Python is its tight integration with Esri‚Äôs desktop GIS applications such as ArcGIS Pro.  This integration allows analysts and researchers to leverage the power of Python to make GIS-based geoprocessing more efficient and accurate by automating many data management, manipulation, and analysis procedures in ways that aren‚Äôt possible using basic tools and models.
